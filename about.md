## GEIST :: MIND <img style="float: right;" src="images/logo_nt.svg">

pronounciation: [ˈɡaɪst]. Geist is German meaning mind. Yet, depending on the context it can also be translated to spirit or ghost. The name stands on it's own, so it's no abbreviation.

The geist project focuses on understanding our Gut feeling and Embodiment to augment our Intellect and Skills using Technology.
