## GEIST :: MIND <img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.url }}images/logo_nt.svg">

Geist has two connotations. First, it's a "Real Project" at the Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University. Second, Geist is a virtual institute and non-profit organisation dedicated to augmenting the human mind, including members from diverse backgrounds.

Geist pronounciation: [ˈɡaɪst]. Geist is German meaning mind. Yet, depending on the context it can also be translated to spirit or ghost. The name stands on it's own, so it's no abbreviation.

The Geist project focuses on understanding our Gut feeling and Embodiment to augment our Intellect and Skills using Technology.
